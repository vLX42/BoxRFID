## Windows Development Setup (PowerShell)

This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for BoxRFID on Windows, and building your own EXE from the code.  
It is designed for users with little or no prior experience in Node.js or Electron development.

---

### **Prerequisites**

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or 11  
- **Terminal:** PowerShell (default on Windows)
- **Admin Rights:** You may need administrator rights to install software

---

### **Step 1: Install Necessary Tools**

Open PowerShell as an administrator and run the following commands one by one.  
This will install Git (for downloading code) and Node.js LTS (needed to build and run Electron apps):

```powershell
winget install -e --id Git.Git
winget install -e --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
```

If you get errors, make sure [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) is available, or install the tools manually from their websites.

---

### **Step 2: Download the BoxRFID Code**

Clone (download) the source code from GitHub:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TinkerBarn/BoxRFID.git
cd BoxRFID
```

---

### **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies**

Install the required packages using npm (Node Package Manager):

```powershell
npm install
```

---

### **Step 4: (Optional) Generate Application Icons**

If you want to customize or regenerate the app icon, place a square PNG (ideally 1024x1024) at `assets\source-icon.png`, then run:

```powershell
npm i -D sharp png-to-ico
node tools/generate-icons-from-png.js
```

If you don't need to change the icon, you can skip this step.

---

### **Step 5: Run the App in Development Mode**

You can test and develop the app before building the EXE:

```powershell
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
npm run dev
```

This will start the app in development mode. If you see errors about missing dependencies, double-check you ran `npm install`.

---

### **Step 6: Build the Windows Executable (EXE)**

To compile the app and create the Windows installer and portable EXE, run:

```powershell
npm run build-win
```

After building, you will find the following files in the `dist\` folder:

- `BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager Setup 1.0.0.exe` (Windows installer)
- `BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager 1.0.0.exe` (portable, runs without installation)

---

### **Notes & Troubleshooting**

- The EXE/installer icon is set in `assets/icon.ico`. If you change the icon, rebuild the EXE.
- If you have issues with permissions, try running PowerShell as Administrator.
- Some antivirus programs may flag newly built EXE files. This is a common false positive for Electron apps you build yourself.
- If you want to update the code, run `git pull` in the `BoxRFID` folder, then repeat the build steps.

## macOS Development Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a development environment for BoxRFID on macOS, and building your own DMG from the code.

---

### **Prerequisites**

- **Operating System:** macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later  
- **Terminal:** Terminal.app or iTerm2
- **Admin Rights:** You may need administrator rights to install software
- **System Dependencies:** Python, pkg-config, and PC/SC Lite for NFC support

---

### **Step 1: Install Necessary Tools**

Open Terminal and install the required tools using Homebrew (install Homebrew first if you don't have it):

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if not already installed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Git, Node.js, and system dependencies
brew install git node python pkg-config pcsc-lite
```

Alternatively, you can download and install Node.js directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

---

### **Step 2: Download the BoxRFID Code**

Clone (download) the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TinkerBarn/BoxRFID.git
cd BoxRFID
```

---

### **Step 3: Install Project Dependencies**

Install the required packages using npm (Node Package Manager):

```bash
npm install
```

---

### **Step 4: (Optional) Generate Application Icons**

If you want to customize or regenerate the app icons, place a square PNG (ideally 1024x1024) at `assets/source-icon.png`, then run:

```bash
npm install -D sharp png-to-ico
node tools/generate-icons-from-png.js
```

If you don't need to change the icons, you can skip this step.

---

### **Step 5: Run the App in Development Mode**

You can test and develop the app before building the DMG:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
```

This will start the app in development mode. If you see errors about missing dependencies, double-check you ran `npm install`.

---

### **Step 6: Build the macOS Executable (DMG)**

To compile the app and create the macOS app, run:

```bash
npm run build-mac
```

After building, you will find the following files in the `dist/` folder:

- `BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager-1.0.0-arm64.dmg` (Apple Silicon M1, M2, etc.)
- `BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager 1.0.0.dmg` (Intel x64)

---

### **Notes & Troubleshooting**

- The macOS app icon comes from `assets/AppIcon.icns`. If you change the icon, rebuild the DMG.
- **macOS Security Warning:** Since this is a self-built app (not signed with a Developer ID certificate), macOS will show a security warning when you first try to open it.
  
  **To bypass the security warning:**
  - **Method 1 (Easiest):** Right-click the app in Applications â†’ Select "Open" â†’ Click "Open" in the dialog
  - **Method 2 (Command line):** Run this command in Terminal:
    ```bash
    sudo xattr -cr '/Applications/BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager.app'
    ```
  - **Method 3 (Helper script):** Run `./install-macos.sh` from the project directory for guided installation

- If you get "App is damaged and can't be opened", run:
  ```bash
  sudo xattr -cr '/Applications/BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager.app'
  sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - '/Applications/BoxRFID â€“ Filament Tag Manager.app'
  ```
- If you have issues with permissions, you may need to allow the app in System Settings > Privacy & Security.
- If you get errors about missing PC/SC Lite during build, make sure you installed the system dependencies: `brew install pkg-config pcsc-lite`
- If native module compilation fails, you may need to install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- If you want to update the code, run `git pull` in the `BoxRFID` folder, then repeat the build steps.

## macOS NFC Reader Setup & Troubleshooting

If the app launches but you see the message `Read error: NFC Reader nicht verbunden` (reader not connected), follow these steps to get your ACR122U (or compatible) working on macOS.

### 1. Hardware Check
1. Plug the ACR122U directly into a USB port (avoid unpowered hubs initially).
2. Use a known-good USB cable (data capable, not charge-only).
3. Run:
  ```bash
  system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -A5 -i "acr"
  ```
  You should see an entry like `ACS ACR122U PICC Interface`.

### 2. PC/SC Service (pcscd) Verification
macOS ships a builtâ€‘in PC/SC daemon. In most cases you do NOT need to install `pcsc-lite` from Homebrew. Before adding extra components, verify the builtâ€‘in service:
```bash
log stream --predicate 'process == "pcscd"' --info | grep -i acr &
sleep 3; # plug or replug reader while this runs
```
Stop with Ctrl+C once you see enumeration messages.

### 3. Optional: Install Open Source Drivers & Tools
If the reader does not appear, you can install the openâ€‘source stack and tools:
```bash
brew install ccid pcsc-tools
```
Then test detection:
```bash
pcsc_scan
```
`pcsc_scan` should list the reader and when you place a tag it should show ATR changes. If this works, the app should also detect cards.

### 4. Confirm Vendor / Product IDs
The genuine ACR122U typically reports Vendor ID `0x072F` and Product ID `0x2200`.
Check via:
```bash
ioreg -p IOUSB -l | grep -i "acr" -A4 | grep -E "idVendor|idProduct"
```
If IDs are different (clone devices sometimes vary), it should still work, but note the variance when troubleshooting.

### 5. Common Causes of "Reader nicht verbunden"
| Cause | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Reader not enumerated | Replug, try different port, avoid hubs |
| PC/SC daemon not responding | Reboot macOS; avoid running a second Homebrew pcscd concurrently |
| Missing CCID driver (rare on modern macOS) | `brew install ccid` |
| Permissions / first-use security prompt | Open System Settings > Privacy & Security and allow app if blocked |
| Faulty cable / insufficient power | Change cable or use powered hub |

### 6. Testing Outside the App
The diagnostic scripts test with system Node, but the app uses Electron's bundled Node. To test reader detection:
```bash
# Quick test in development mode (best approach)
NODE_ENV=development npm start
# Watch console for reader connection messages

# Alternative: Check if reader visible to system
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -i acr
```

### 7. Card Placement Tips
The ACR122U antenna is usually near the top surface under the logo. If reads intermittently:
- Try placing tag flat and still for 1â€“2 seconds.
- Rotate 180Â° or flip if detection fails.
- Avoid metallic surfaces directly under the reader.

### 8. Reset / Recover Sequence
If everything appears stuck:
```bash
killall pcscd 2>/dev/null || true
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.pcscd 2>/dev/null || true
sudo launchctl start com.apple.pcscd
unplug && replug the reader
pcsc_scan
```

### 9. Diagnostic Script
You can run the helper script to collect basic info:
```bash
./diagnose-reader-macos.sh
./setup-macos-reader.sh   # (alternative) performs install + quick detection
```
It will print USB enumeration, pcscd status, and attempt a minimal Node detection run.

### 10. When It Still Fails
Gather output from:
```bash
pcsc_scan
node -e 'const { NFC } = require("nfc-pcsc"); new NFC()'
log show --last 5m | grep -i pcscd
```
Then compare with working examples or open an issue with logs attached.

### Summary (Quick Fix Path)
1. Plug reader directly â†’ verify with `system_profiler`.
2. Install tools: `brew install pcsc-tools` â†’ run `pcsc_scan`.
3. If missing: install `brew install ccid`.
4. Use diagnostic script if still failing.
5. Confirm the app now shows connection (green indicator).
 6. (Optional) Run `./setup-macos-reader.sh` for automated steps.
