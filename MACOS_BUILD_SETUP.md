- Dynamic linker environment variables

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflows
✅ Created two workflow files:

#### .github/workflows/build-macos.yml
- Builds macOS DMG for both x64 and arm64
- Installs required system dependencies (pcsc-lite, pkg-config)
- Handles native module compilation
- Uploads artifacts and releases

#### .github/workflows/build-all.yml
- Cross-platform build for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Automatic release uploads on tags
- Platform-specific dependency handling

### 5. README Updates
✅ Updated README.md with:
- Changed description from "Windows app" to "cross-platform app"
- Added credit to LexyGuru for macOS compatibility
- Added complete macOS development setup section
- Updated download section to mention all platforms
- Added macOS-specific troubleshooting information
